1. We need to create a model to retrieve or send JSON data because the help to structure the data received from/sent to the server. The models map JSON keys to easily accessible attributes to reduce errors in manual parsing. The models also ease modification or extending data handling logic so that if the API changes, we can only modify the model instead of updating the code throughout the app. Models also ensure that the data types and formats are consistent so that it avoids runtime type errors.

2. We use the http library in this task to send HTTP requests and receive responses from a server. In the context of this assignment, the http library facilitates communication between my Flutter app and the Django backend by sending data (like login credentials) and receiving responses (like authentication tokens or user data).

3. CookieRequest is typically a custom class or library that manages HTTP requests while handling cookies automatically. In web-based authentication, cookies are used to maintain user sessions. They automatically store and send cookies (ex:  session IDs) with each request, ensuring authenticated communication. They also simplify making authenticated requests by abstracting cookie handling and prevents manually adding sensitive data like session tokens in headers. We share it across components in Flutter because it ensures that all components of the app share the same session state and avoids redundancy and minimizes resource usage. It also ensures requests made from any part of the app are authenticated (using the same cookies).

4. Input:
- User provides input (ex: form data) in the Flutter UI and validated locally
Data Transmission:
- The validated input is sent to the backend using an HTTP request (ex: POST with JSON payload)
- The backend processes the data and sends a response (ex: success or failure, along with data)
Processing Response:
- The app parses the backend's JSON response into a model object or directly extracts relevant data.
- Errors are handled, and feedback is shown to the user.
Display:
- Parsed data is passed to Flutter widgets for rendering on the UI.

5. Login Process:
1. Flutter: 
- user enters credentials (ex: email and password)
- app sends a POST request with the credentials to the Django backend
2. Django: 
- verifies the credentials against the database
- if valid, generates a session token or returns an existing session cookie
- sends a success response (ex: 200 OK) including the session token or cookie
3. Flutter:
- stores the session token or cookie using CookieRequest or local storage
- navigates to the authenticated area (ex: dashboard)

Register Process:
1. Flutter:
- user provides registration data (ex:  email, username, password)
- sends the data to the Django backend via a POST request
2. Django:
- validates the data and creates a new user account
- returns a success response or errors (ex:  "email already exists")
3. Flutter:
- if successful, redirects to the login screen.

Logout Process:
1. Flutter:
- sends a logout request to Django (ex:  POST /logout)
- clears stored session data locally
2. Django:
- deletes the session token or cookie
- returns a success response

6. This assignment asks us for Django-Flutter authentication integration. We do this by firstly setting up the authentication in Django for Flutter. Here we make a new django-app called authentication, and add it into INSTALLED_APPS, here we also install django-cors-headers, then we add the view methods and routings for login in the authentication app.

The next step would be to integrate the authentication system in Flutter. Here we run the commands flutter pub add provider and flutter pub add pbp_django_auth and then provide CookieRequest library using Provider and took care of login. We also made a register function here and took care of its views and url routing.

After that we customed model creation by using JSON data with the Quicktype website, then we fetched Data from Django and showed them in the Flutter app by adding HTTP dependency. We fetch the data by the list_productentry.dart and left drawer.

To integrate the Flutter form with the Django Service, we:
1. Create a new views function and take care of the routing in Django
2. Connect product_entry_form.dart to CookieRequest in Flutter

Last we implement the logout feature by adding a views method in the authentication app and take care of the url routing in Django, then edit the CookieRequest and Inkwell in Flutter

1. Const ensures that a created object is immutable, hence its state cannot be changed after creation. 

Advantages:
- Optimizes performance by making Flutter recognize certain objects to be pre-built and immutable, which allows Flutter to just reuse objects instead of creating new ones, hence avoiding unnecessary calculations and object allocations. Const keyword also instructs Dart VM to perform optimizations at compile time (faster object creation).
- Makes code easier to understand and since the objects cannot be changed after creation, it simplifies how data flows through our app to reduce risk of unexpected behavior and eases the debugging process.
- Reduces unnecessary widget creation and rebuilds.
- Easier testing and composing complex functionalities.

When to use:
- Immutable data objects: colors, configurations, data that shouldn't change.
- Pre-defined Values: API endpoints or static values
- Optimizing widget trees: reduces unnecessary widget creation

When NOT to use:
- Dynamic data: if an object's data needs to be modified after creation
- Network calls: objects fetching data from external sources


2. Columns arranges child widgets vertically (top to bottom), it is more suitable when content needs to be displayed in a single column (ex: list of options, form, vertical buttons)
Example:
Column(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
  children: [
    const Text(
      'Product Entry Form',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    ),
    const SizedBox(height: 8),
    TextFormField(
      decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'Product Name',
        border: OutlineInputBorder(),
      ),
    ),
    const SizedBox(height: 8),
    TextFormField(
      decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'Description',
        border: OutlineInputBorder(),
      ),
    ),
    const SizedBox(height: 8),
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {},
      child: const Text('Save'),
    ),
  ],
)

Rows arranges child widgets horizontally (left to right), it is more suitable when content displays icons or buttons side-by-side.
Example:
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
  children: [
    InfoCard(title: 'NPM', content: npm),
    InfoCard(title: 'Name', content: name),
    InfoCard(title: 'Class', content: className),
  ],
),

3. The input elements used in this project so far is just TextFormField since the input we receive is just text for now. It is used to enter text in both Name and Description fields and used to input numeric values for Amount field. There are other common input elements in Flutter, examples include:
- DropdownButtonFormField: displays dropdown menu to select set value from list of options
- Checkbox: displays checkbox for Boolean values, used for options like Agrre to Terms, etc.
- Radio: allows user to select a single option from multiple choices
- Slider: allows user to select value from range by sliding thumb along a track, used to adjust values such as volume, brightness, etc.
- Switch: toggle switch for true/false values, often used for settings or preferences
- etc.

4. We can ensure consistency by defining it in the MaterialApp widget, the theme property accepts a ThemeData objects to set colors, text styles, button themes, etc. I also implemented a theme by using Theme.of(context) function.

5. I used a Navigator class to push and pop routes. I used Navigator.push to go to a new page and Navigator.pop to return to the previous page. For apps with a drawer or bottom navigation bar, the PageView widget or a state management solution can be used to maintain the state of each screen.

assignment 7
1. State of Widget: the information about the properties held by the objects at time of creation and can change when it is used.
Stateless Widget: Immutable widgets, appearance and properties do not change throughout the existence of the widget (cannot change state), ex: Icon, IconButton, Text
Stateful Widget: Widgets that change properties during runtime, they are dynamic, mutable and can change its appearance according to events triggered by user interaction or when it receives data, ex: Checkbox, Slider, Form

2. - MyHomePage: this is the main widget that displays InfoCard and ItemCard widgets on the home page
- InfoCard: displays NPM, Name, Class details
- ItemHomepage: this is a data model to store button information (name and icon) tht helps structure the ItemCard widgets
- ItemCard: displays clickable cards ("View Product List, "Add Product", "Logout")
- GridView: used to arrange ItemCard into 3 column layout

3. setState() in Flutter is used to:
- Update the UI with New Values: It re-renders parts of the widget tree with updated data, useful for making the app responsive to changes.
- Trigger Stateful Changes (counters, input fields, or dynamically loaded data)
- Respond to User Interactions: For instance, if a user toggles a setting, setState() is used to reflect that change immediately on the screen.
- Handle Async Operations: Often used after fetching data or other asynchronous tasks, where you want to update the UI once the data is ready.

setState() affects only the state variables within a stateful widget. When you call setState(), it:
- Takes a callback that contains updates to variables declared in the widgetâ€™s state class.
- Triggers a rebuild of the widget, ensuring only the parts of the UI that rely on the updated variables are redrawn.

4. Both 'const' and 'final' are used to keep the value of a variable static (once defined, its state cannot be changed), however,
final: used to hardcore the values of variable and cannot be altered in the future, no operations on these variables can change its value.
const: behaves like 'final', but 'const' makes the variable constant from compile-time only, so if we use it on an object, it will make the object's entire deep state fixed at compile-time and objects with this state are considered frozen and completely immutable.

5. First we generate a new project and run it to see that we have our page, then we reorganize it so that we can understnad our code easily. We reorganize it by moving class MyHomePage and class _MyHomePageState from main.dart to menu.dart. Finally, we create 5 widgets. This is done ny changing the app theme color, then, changing the widget page menu to stateless. Next, we create card with NPM, Name and Class, then we create the buttons, finally, we integrate InfoCard and ItemCard using GridView.
